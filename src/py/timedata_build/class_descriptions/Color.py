A $name is an immutable floating point color.

     A $name looks like a Python tuple with $$size floating point numbers, with
     the big exception that operators like + and * perform arithmetic, not
     list-style operations.

     The constructor for $name takes a triple of numbers but also strings
     representing human-readable color names like "red" and "green".

     $name supports the operations `+`, `-`, `\\*`, `/`, `%`, `pow`, and `~`
     (which means "take the complementary color").

     ${name}s are very lightweight - about half the size of a corresponding
     Python tuple and more than twice as fast to create and copy.  ${name}s
     are also immutable - all operations on ${name}s have to create a new
     $name.

     The expected range of components in the color is from 0 to $range but
     it's perfectly acceptable to have any value in intermediate calculations,
     even infinity.""",
